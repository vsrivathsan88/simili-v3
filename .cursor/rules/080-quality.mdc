# Logging
- Use a tiny logger util: `debug/info/warn/error` with module tags.
- Log WS lifecycle, frame counts, and VAD decisions at `debug` (dev only).

# Error boundaries
- One app-level error boundary; show a friendly “Reload session” with state reset.

# Dev toggles
- `?debugAudio=1` → draw waveform + RMS meter overlay.
- `?mockTools=1` → intercept tool calls with fixtures.
