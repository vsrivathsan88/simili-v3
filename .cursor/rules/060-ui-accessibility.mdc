# Transcript console
- Container `role="log"` `aria-live="polite"`; each turn has `data-speaker="user|ai"` and a timestamp.
- Provide copy-to-clipboard per turn; keep virtualization simple (no scrolling jank).

# Controls
- Space/Enter toggles connect/disconnect when focused.
- Visible focus rings; minimum 44x44px tap targets.

# Color/typography
- Minimum 4.5:1 contrast. Prefer system fonts for perf; you may later swap to Atkinson Hyperlegible.
