## 📊 Current Status

| Phase | Status | Test URL |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Phase 1: Daily.co Only | ✅ Complete | `?test=daily` |
| Phase 2: Daily + Gemini | ✅ Complete | `?test=gemini` |
| Phase 3: Production Switch | ⏳ Pending | Coming next |

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Test page won't load
- **Solution:** Run `npm run dev` first

**Problem:** "WebSocket connection failed"
- **Solution:** Server might not be running. Check terminal for `[server] listening on http://localhost:3001`

**Problem:** Connected but no greeting
- **Solution:** Click "Start Recording" button

**Problem:** No audio from Pi
- **Solution:** Check browser console for AudioStreamer errors
